<!-- This template is just a suggestion, feel free to ignore or delete it -->

**What can't you do right now?**
<!-- Describe what you'd like to do with fflate but can't with the current API -->
<!-- If you think what you need may be possible to do already, that's fine too - I can update the docs to make it easier to understand -->

**An optimal solution**
<!-- Describe the features you'd like added, optimally with some example code -->
<!-- Code samples are incredibly helpful for deciding whether a feature is worth adding -->

**(How) is this done by other libraries?**
<!-- Describe how JSZip, Pako, UZIP.js, tiny-inflate, etc. solve the same problem -->
<!-- If they don't support this feature at all, remove this section -->

<!-- List any other context, comments, or clarifications you have here -->
